For configuring iTerm to translate `Ctrl+N` as the Down arrow keystroke, which typically navigates to the next command in the shell history, you would use the ANSI escape sequence for the Down arrow, which is `\[B`.

Here's what you would enter in the iTerm2 preferences to set this up:

1. Open iTerm2 Preferences (`Cmd + ,`).
2. Go to the "Profiles" tab.
3. Select your profile in the list on the left.
4. Go to the "Keys" tab for that profile.
5. Click the "+" button to add a new key binding.
6. With "Keyboard Shortcut" selected, press `Ctrl+N`.
7. For the action, choose "Send Escape Sequence".
8. In the input box that appears, enter `B`.

So the complete escape sequence you enter is just the letter `B`, without any brackets or slashes when you're in the iTerm2 key mapping interface. This tells iTerm2 to send the ANSI escape sequence corresponding to the Down arrow key when you press `Ctrl+N`.

Remember, when you configure this key binding, it might override other default behaviors of `Ctrl+N` in the terminal or within text-based applications that run in the terminal.


For Up arrow escape sequence is '[B'
